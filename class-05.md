# Node JS And Heroku

Node.js is V8 (the JavaScript engine running inside Google Chrome) bundled together with a couple of libraries, mainly to do I/O - i.e. writing files and handling network connections.

It's important to note that Node.js isn't any special dialect of JavaScript - it is just normal, modern JavaScript, running everywhere instead of just the browser.

Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript everywhere instead of just in browsers - the two big mainstream uses as of writing are web/app servers (Node.js is very well-suited for messaging-like applications

What are the advantages of learning Node?

If you already know JavaScript you don’t need to learn a new language to write back end code.
It is incredibly fast for handling traffic
What is Node used for?
It’s also great for API’s and real-time applications (like instant messaging or games).

Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) and so it provides you the typical PaaS use cases:

Simple create backing service instances for your web application (e.g. PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, ...)
Simple deploy your web application (e.g. a Ruby on Rails application)
Simple scale your web application vertically and horizontally
Ensure the desired amount of application instances is running

These use cases reduce waste in the development process since there is no need for the application developers to talk to an operations departments when setting up their applications and they help to continuously deliver new features.

Note: to benefit from the advantages above, you have to consider some basic rules when writing your application
